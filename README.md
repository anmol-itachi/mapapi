MY IDEA

" Unified Database of Victims and missing people maintained by Disaster Management team. "

# The idea is to create a database where data about the victims  rescued by the rescue team  is updated periodically .
# And also data about people who are stuck in some locations , who are still to be rescued is updated by first response team of disaster management , whose main objective is to collect and quantify data which helps in  further ground rescue operations .

# If someone suspects that their friend is in a specific area/region during a natural disaster , they can make a request in that database in the name of their missing person and few details about them like facebook data etc.The rescue team will update any information known  about the person. 

# Also during disasters , communities(localities) of people need few basic needs like food , water etc ,in required quantities. If those needs are  known in required quantities , it is easy for rescuers to make those requirements available .So the goods required and their quantity if updated in the unified database.

# After disaster , the first thing restored is communication networks even before complete rescue in most of the cases. So if there is any medical emergency in any location , they can request a emergency rescue , which leads to a priority rescue operation ,and if rescued , will save many lives.The medical condition can also be shared , so the needed  first aid is made available by rescue teams at the time of rescue.;

All the above operations are done with the help of single website.
